## A visual introduction to a first run with a special container

The link in the **New Container Bookmark** dialogue will open a tab that *appears* to be troublesome. 

In the context of the Container Bookmarks extension, there's *no* trouble here. Ignore the invitation to try again. Aim for the toolbar icon for **Multi-Account Containers**:

Choose **Always Open This Site in…**

After choosing a container, there'll be another new tab – in the required container – with the appearance of trouble. Again, ignore the invitation to try again.

– with no trouble ☑

### Why the apparent trouble?

The *Server Not Found* pages are an unavoidable side effect of this extension's workaround to Firefox Multi-Account Containers [enhancement request 854](https://github.com/mozilla/multi-account-containers/issues/854), which is not yet implemented by Mozilla.
